# volunteer-log

This is a moderately developed Rails webapp for signing in/out Explorer volunteers. 
The idea was to replace the paper sign-in/sign-out sheets in the main office with an electronic process using 
the (as of mid-2017) unused all-in-one computer.

I'd given this skunk-works project to a high school student to use as a learning experience for doing Rails 
development, but his priorities changed over time, so this app was never completed.
